#+title: Redditor Dump


A use case is when you lose your Reddit account and need to resubscribe to all the
subreddits you did subscribe to before; it is not possible to get them without a developer
API associated with application acceptance from that account; however all of the account
submission is still available in the profile (the public ones); using this program you can
get a list of all the subreddits a user is involved (did submissions or comments) in.

* Installation
You need first to satisfy the following python dependencies:

#+begin_example
ascii_graph
numpy
colorama
requests
#+end_example

And [[https://go.dev/doc/install][install go]].

change your current directory to ~rdump~ then run:

#+begin_example
go build cmd/rdump.go
#+end_example

* Usage
Use the executable file to get the desired data. An example with a random user +clewell+:
#+begin_example
work [rdump:main?>]$ ./cmd/cmd clewell
All subreddit clelwell is involved in:(sorted by frequency)
